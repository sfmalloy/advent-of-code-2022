# Advent of Code 2022

These solutions are in Python 3, and some may use Python 3.11 features. Might throw some bonus solutions in other languages in the `extras` directory too for fun. You can run either a single day to get its answer and runtime, or run all the available days and get their combined runtime.

### Run single:
```
python run.py -d <day_number>
```

### Run all:
```
python run.py -a
```
