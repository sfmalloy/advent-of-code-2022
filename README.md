# Advent of Code 2022

These solutions are in Python 3 (and sometimes x86 assembly, see extras). You can run either a single day to get its answer and runtime, or run all the available days and get their combined runtime.

### Run single:
```
python run.py -d <day_number>
```

### Run all:
```
python run.py -a
```
